project: Google play app rating prediction with deployment on heroku.
Description: Developed and executed a machine learning model using Python in Google Colab to predict app
ratings on the Google Play Store. Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values, and
employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Utilized a Random Forest Regressor
to predict app ratings with an accuracy of 89.3% on the training data and 43.45% on the test data. Subsequently,
created a user-friendly web application using Django for users to access the prediction model. Finally, deployed
the project on the Heroku platform via GitHub, making the app accessible to a broader audience.
Role: Led the end-to-end project, from data preprocessing and modeling to web app creation and deployment.
Achievements: Successfully developed an accurate app rating prediction model and deployed it on Heroku,
providing user-friendly access to app ratings.
Skills Used: Python, Machine Learning, Google Colab, Data Preprocessing, PCA, Random Forest, Django, Heroku,
